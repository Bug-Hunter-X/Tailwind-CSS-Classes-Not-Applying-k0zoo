# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying

This repository demonstrates a bug where some Tailwind CSS classes are not being applied correctly. The issue occurs in a simple div element, where background color and padding classes are expected but not rendered.

## Bug Description

The `bg-red-500` and `p-4` classes are not being applied to the div element in `bug.js`.  The text inside the div should appear with a red background and padding, but does not.  This may be due to a variety of reasons, such as:

* **Incorrect build process:** The Tailwind CSS build process may not have compiled correctly.
* **Configuration errors:** The `tailwind.config.js` file may have incorrect configuration options.
* **CSS conflicts:** Conflicting CSS rules from other sources may be overriding the Tailwind CSS classes.
* **Incorrect Import Paths:** Tailwind CSS styles might not be correctly imported.

## Solution

The solution provided in `bugSolution.js` addresses the issue by ensuring that Tailwind CSS is correctly configured and that there are no conflicting styles. Specific solutions are dependent on the exact cause of the issue. 

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run a build command specific to your environment (e.g., `npm run build` or `npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch`).
4. Open `index.html` in a web browser and observe the lack of styling.
5. Compare `bug.js` with `bugSolution.js` to understand the correction.
